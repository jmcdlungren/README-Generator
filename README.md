## Description

This generator will assist in creating a README file with all necessary requirements built in. My motivation was to create something that would assist with future projects as they will each need a README file.

## Installation

## Usage

When needing to create a README, run "node index" within the terminal. It will then prompt you with a series of questions to be answered. The answers will then fill in to their respective sections in the README file.
